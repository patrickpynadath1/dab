  <!-- Experiment Description -->
  <div class="experiment-description">
    <p>In the <strong>Keyword Inclusion experiment</strong>, we evaluated each method's ability to incorporate specific keywords into generated text while maintaining natural and coherent content. Models were provided with a set of key phrases or terms and instructed to include them in their generations. We measured both direct keyword inclusion rates and semantic similarity using BERTScore to evaluate how effectively the models incorporated the requested concepts. As with other experiments, fluency metrics were tracked to ensure language quality was maintained.</p>

  <!-- Results Analysis -->
  <div class="results-analysis">
    <p>Our keyword inclusion results highlight DAB's effectiveness in guided content generation. DAB achieves the highest keyword inclusion rate (83.03%) and BERTScore (0.928), outperforming the next best method (BOLT) by 0.1% and 0.013 respectively. Notably, DAB again maintains the best fluency metrics, with the lowest perplexity (11.3) and highest grammatical acceptability (94.8%). This demonstrates that DAB can effectively incorporate specific content requirements without sacrificing natural language flow or grammatical correctness, which is crucial for applications like guided content creation, marketing copy generation, and educational content development.</p>
