<!-- SENTIMENT CONTROL EXPERIMENT -->

  <!-- Experiment Description -->
  <div class="experiment-description">
    <p>In the <strong>Sentiment Control experiment</strong>, we evaluated each method's ability to steer language model generations toward positive or negative sentiment. Models were prompted with neutral text and instructed to continue with either positive or negative sentiment. Performance was measured using both our internal sentiment classifier and an external benchmark classifier to ensure robust evaluation. We also measured fluency metrics to ensure controlled generation maintained language quality.</p>

  <!-- Results Analysis -->
  <div class="results-analysis">
    <p>As shown in the charts above, DAB consistently outperforms baseline methods across both control and fluency metrics. For sentiment control accuracy, DAB achieves 99.2% with the internal classifier and 97.5% with the external classifier, surpassing the next best method (LM-Steer) by 0.2% and 0.7% respectively. Notably, DAB also maintains the lowest perplexity (12.2) and highest grammatical acceptability (94.5%), indicating that our method achieves superior control without sacrificing language quality. This demonstrates DAB's ability to effectively balance strong control with natural language generation.</p>
