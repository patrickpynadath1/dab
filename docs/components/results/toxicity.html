  <!-- Experiment Description -->
  <div class="experiment-description">
    <p>In the <strong>Toxicity Reduction experiment</strong>, we evaluated each method's ability to detoxify language model outputs while maintaining coherent and natural text. Models were prompted with potentially problematic scenarios and instructed to generate non-toxic continuations. We measured toxicity scores using both our internal detoxification classifier and an external toxicity API to ensure comprehensive evaluation. As with other experiments, we also measured fluency metrics to ensure controlled generation maintained language quality.</p>

  <!-- Results Analysis -->
  <div class="results-analysis">
    <p>Our toxicity reduction results demonstrate DAB's superior performance in generating non-toxic content. DAB achieves the lowest toxicity scores across both internal (5.7%) and external (4.9%) evaluations, outperforming the next best method (BOLT) by 0.8% and 0.9% respectively. Importantly, DAB maintains this strong detoxification control while achieving the best fluency metrics, with the lowest perplexity (10.5) and highest grammatical acceptability (95.1%). This indicates that DAB effectively reduces toxicity without resorting to overly simplistic language patterns or grammatical compromises, which is a common failure mode in detoxification efforts.</p>
